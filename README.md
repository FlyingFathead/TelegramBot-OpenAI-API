# üêß Installing without Docker on Linux

## Prerequisites
- Tested & working on Python `3.10.12` to `3.12.2`
- Install required Python packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt` (tested and working with the versions listed in [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt)
- `pydub` usually requires `ffmpeg` to be installed separately. Note that neither `pydub` nor `ffmpeg` are practically not required if you are *not* utilizing the voice message/WhisperAPI functionality, but if you are, suggested install (Debian/Ubuntu Linux): `sudo apt-get install ffmpeg`
- NOTE: DuckDuckGo searches require `lynx` to be installed on your system; it needs to be run as a subprocess. (Install on Debian/Ubuntu Linux with: `sudo apt-get install lynx`)

1. **Clone the repository with:**

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/FlyingFathead/TelegramBot-OpenAI-API/ &&
  cd TelegramBot-OpenAI-API/
  ```

2. **Install the required packages:**

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

3. **(Recommended) install the optional packages:**

  - On Ubuntu/Debian tree Linux systems:

  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install -y ffmpeg lynx
  ```

3. **Set up your Telegram bot token:**

  - Either set your Telegram Bot API token as `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` environment variable, or put it into a text file named `bot_token.txt` inside the `config/` directory (= `config/bot_token.txt`)

4. **Set up your OpenAI API token:**

  - Either as `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable or put into a text file named `api_token.txt` inside the main program directory

5. **Other modules:**

  - If you wish to use the OpenWeatherMap API and the MapTiler API for i.e. localized weather data retrieval, set the `OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY` and the `MAPTILER_API_KEY` environment variables accordingly. You can get the API keys from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/) and [MapTiler](https://www.maptiler.com/)
  - Additional weather info (moon phases, weather warnings etc) are fetched from [WeatherAPI](https://weatherapi.com), set the `WEATHERAPI_KEY` environment variable to use it.
  - If you wish to use the Openrouteservice API for driving instructions, set the `OPENROUTESERVICE_API_KEY` environment variable from [Openrouteservice](https://openrouteservice.org/)
  - If you wish to use Perplexity API's supplementary fact-checking with their online models, register at [Perplexity.ai](https://perplexity.ai), buy some API credits and set your Perplexity API key to environment variable: `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`

6. **Further adjustments:**

  - Adjust your configuration and settings by editing `config/config.ini` to your liking

7. **Run:**

- Run the program with: `python src/main.py`

# üê≥ **Installing Dockerized**

### **Prerequisites**
1. **Docker** must be installed on your machine.
   - If not installed, you can download and install it from [Docker's official site](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

2. **Telegram Bot API Key** and **OpenAI API Key**:
   - You will need a valid Telegram Bot API key. You can get one by creating a bot with [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather).
   - You will also need an OpenAI API key. If you don't have one, you can generate it from the [OpenAI API page](https://beta.openai.com/signup/).

### **Step 1: Clone the Repository**

First, clone the repository from GitHub:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/FlyingFathead/TelegramBot-OpenAI-API.git
  cd TelegramBot-OpenAI-API
  ```

### **Step 2: Run the Setup Script**

This project includes a setup script that will guide you through entering your API keys and generating a `.env` file.

Run the script:

  ```bash
  ./docker_setup.sh
  ```

Follow the instructions provided by the script. It will ask for your OpenAI API key and Telegram Bot API key, validate them, and create a `.env` file with your credentials.

### **Step 3: Build the Docker Image**

Once your `.env` file has been created, you need to build the Docker image.

You can run the featured `docker_deploy.sh` to build the Docker image:

  ```bash
  sudo ./docker_deploy.sh
  ```

Or, you can build it manually:

  ```bash
  sudo docker build -t telegrambot-openai-api .
  ```

This will build the image locally based on the `Dockerfile` in the repository.

### **Step 4: Run the Docker Container**

After the image is successfully built, you can start the bot in a Docker container.

Run the container with the following command:

  ```bash
  sudo docker run --env-file .env --name telegrambot-openai-api -d telegrambot-openai-api
  ```

- The `-d` flag runs the container in detached mode (in the background).
- The `--env-file .env` flag injects your API keys into the container.

### **Step 5: Check the Running Container**

You can check if the container is running by using:

  ```bash
  sudo docker ps
  ```

This will list all running containers. If your bot is running correctly, it should appear in the list.

### **Step 6: Stopping the Container**

If you need to stop the bot, you can do so by running:

  ```bash
  sudo docker stop <container_id>
  ```

Replace `<container_id>` with the actual container ID, which you can obtain from the `docker ps` output.

### **Additional Steps (Optional)**

- **Logs**: If you need to view the bot‚Äôs logs to troubleshoot any issues, you can use:

  ```bash
  sudo docker logs <container_id>
  ```

- **Restart the Container**: If you stop the container and want to start it again, you can either run the `docker run` command again or restart the existing container with:

  ```bash
  sudo docker start <container_id>
  ```

### **Updating the Bot**

If the repository receives updates and you want to apply them, follow these steps:

1. Pull the latest changes from GitHub:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. Rebuild the Docker image:
   ```bash
   sudo docker build -t telegrambot-openai-api .
   ```

3. Stop the currently running container:
   ```bash
   sudo docker stop <container_id>
   ```

4. Start a new container using the updated image:
   ```bash
   sudo docker run --env-file .env --name telegrambot-openai-api -d telegrambot-openai-api
   ```

There is also a `docker_deploy.sh` script included that aims to make the rebuilding and deploying less of a hassle.

You should now have the TelegramBot-OpenAI-API running in a Docker container, fully connected to both Telegram and OpenAI. Enjoy your bot!

If you run into any issues, consult the logs or reach out on the repository's [Issues page](https://github.com/FlyingFathead/TelegramBot-OpenAI-API/issues).

# Updating your `config.ini`

- Use the `configmerger.py` to update old configuration files into a newer version's `config.ini`. You can do this by saving a copy of your existing config to i.e. a file named `myconfig.txt` and including in it the lines you want to keep for the newer version. 

- After that, just run i.e. `python src/configmerger.py myconfig.txt` and all your existing config lines will be migrated to the new one. Works in most cases, but remember to be careful and double-check any migration issues with i.e. `diff`!

**(Example) How to merge and update your existing configuration:**

  ```bash
  python3 src/configmerger.py myconfig.txt
  ```

# Changelog
- v0.76 ‚Äì **Premium mode auto-switching** + usage DB synergy
  - Added daily usage-based auto-switch logic between ‚Äúpremium‚Äù vs. ‚Äúmini‚Äù models (see `[ModelAutoSwitch]` in `config.ini`).
  - Once you exceed the `PremiumTokenLimit`, the bot seamlessly switches to the fallback model.
  - If that fallback also goes past `MiniTokenLimit`, the bot can either deny usage or proceed, according to `FallbackLimitAction`.
  - New param `model_info` for logging function calls, so the ‚ÄúBot‚Äù lines in your chat log can show which model/tier is used (i.e. `model=gpt-4, tier=premium, usage=12345/500000`).
  - Some small bugfixes for the SQLite usage DB, ensuring we properly update `premium_tokens` or `mini_tokens` after each request based on the `usage` field in OpenAI‚Äôs response.
- 0.75056 - switched to newer Perplexity API models due to new models / old model depreciation
  - see [Perplexity API guide for supported models](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/model-cards)

- v0.75052 - include the details from U.S. National Weather Service on alerts
- v0.75051 - updated `config.ini` for configuring NWS weather forecasts & alerts
  - suggested method is to supplement via NWS the additional weather data you need
  - leaving U.S. NWS's weather alerts on in `config.ini` is highly recommended, even if you have other fetching methods enabled (i.e. OpenWeatherMap), rather be safe than sorry
- v0.7505 - U.S. NWS (National Weather Service, [weather.gov](https://weather.gov)) added as a weather data source
